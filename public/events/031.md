# ??? ‚ÄèIron Desert // 8.6.5014U

A distress call was detected on our comms, causing **TAROT** and **CLAYMORE** to investigate despite the rough desert conditions. **RECOIL** is deployed along with an APC of supplies in case the distress signal needs.

At the distress signal, an individual by the name of **Linnea** was found and recovered. However, Rusts moved in not too long after, also having detected the signal.

After a perilous battle, the group emerged victorious and escorted **Linnea** back. With nothing else to do, they have decided to join our ranks under the callsign **TAG**.
