# ??? Pirate Radio Tower // 7.28.5014U

Venturing through the Iron Desert is tough work, being overly hot. However, the **Pirate Radio Tower** isn't too far. **TSUCHINOKO**, **SPIRIT**, **JESTIE**, and **CLAYMORE** decide to use their efforts to deliver an attack on it - although with a cursory examination first, in case things go awry or it seems unlikely.

However the group goes in is up to their discretion, but it is critical that you escape if things are going downhill. Losing a pilot is not worth the success of the mission.
