# ??? Alpine Orbital Station // 7.26.5014U

With the Rust off the trail for now, the company is free to explore and expand. The first group of **CLAYMORE**, **RECOIL**, **TAROT**, and **ATLAS** decides its efforts will be exploring the new lands - and one of interest nearby is the **Alpine Orbital Station**. It contains a higher concentration of Rusts, and thusly probably has something interesting or important to them.

Deploying out to either aquire resources or figure out what that something important might be, they delve into the snowy lands which are out of place compared to the iron deserts.
