With the previous group currently locked into battle, **TIMECALLER** calls for **TSUCHINOKO** and **ATLAS** to invade an installation revealed by information gathered during the fighting, in attempt to stop a 'secret weapon' and reinforcements from reaching the area.

After infiltrating the installation, they encountered an AI - designation **SPIRIT**. With the squad, they locked down and captured the installation. The secret weapon was recovered and is now **SPIRIT**'s mech, and the reinforcements were completely stuffed. The installation is free to be used by the company.
