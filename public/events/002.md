# SHARD - ‚ÄèAlpine Orbital Station // 9.5.5014U

While your current base is good and gathering resources from the **Alpine** is manageable, **THE WALL** has suggested the possibility of making a forward base. Considering the coverage it would provide you on the land portion of your map, it would be a good idea.

You have the opportunity to put it anywhere, however a key location may be near the mine - there's an exposed part of the crystal cave that might make good for a way into the mine as well as provide power and exist on the edge of **Rust** influence.

After making it to the site, a **Rust** mining operation was swiftly dealt with, leaving us the place and giving us the ability to set up a base there. It will take some time before it's complete however, and it may need defending from time to time.
