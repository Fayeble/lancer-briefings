# ??? Home Base // 7.5.5014U

As everyone returns home, **TIMECALLER** puts a few on patrol duty of the base, a bad feeling rousing in his stomach. **THE WALL**, **CLAYMORE**, and **RECOIL** opted in while the others took the time to continue putting things back together.

On the horizon, something can be seen - and heard - moving. Steps of robotic legs, and a bright green glow. It seems someone's back, this time to properly punish those who messed up their operation - and with a much bigger army.
