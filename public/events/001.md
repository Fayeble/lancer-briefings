The first official operation of the new company is underway. With all the pilots together in one place, they have realized their resources are lacking.

**TIMECALLER** suggests that the best course of operations is to attempt to claim some resources and contacts from the Reclamation City, essentially the biggest (friendly) force on **FARIVIUS**. Deciding that a force home might be worthwhile considering potential developments or bandit intervention, he splits the roster in half.

**CLAYMORE**, **TAROT**, **RECOIL**, **JESTIE** and **SLICK** are dispatched as the force attempting to negotiate with the city.
