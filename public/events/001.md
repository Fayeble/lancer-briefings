# SHARD - Reclamation City // 8.18.5014U

As a recreational activity, **PYRE** suggested that a small team would go out and investigate some leads on a weapon rumored to exist. After **CLAYMORE**, **TAROT**, and **TAG** decide to go out, he leads them to **Reclamation City** where they will inquire the locals about the stories and legends about the item.

After some... unfortunate events, the group finds a crashed station which held a room of old and forgotten relics, including a railgun of sorts.
