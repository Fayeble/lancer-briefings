# SHARD - ‚ÄèReclamation City // 9.7.5014U

Several people put requests in for materials for their projects, and your ability to acquire them has been a bit limited. However, you have found a seller that would work - though they want a special form of payment other than money.

While their means of why isn't entirely obvious, they're willing to part with some materials on the grounds that you participate in a recreational mech fight within **Reclamation City**. The best guess would be they want to rig bets in their favor, and are willing to part with some things if you end up getting it for them.

There's a high chance they would be willing to part with more or that others would be willing to partner or throw some extra things your way if you give a good show.
