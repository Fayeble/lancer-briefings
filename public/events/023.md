# ??? ‚ÄèIron Desert // 8.12.5014U

After **TIMECALLER** gained the support of an outside source, we have acquired a connection to get us upgrades, help, and various other resources. **PYRE** will be our median in the project.

**PYRE** has told us about anti-air batteries that reside in the desert, likely under Rust control, as they shoot upon almost anything above. Before we can fully secure support, we have to gain control or destroy the batteries so that we can land ships near our base.

**SPIRIT**, **SLICK**, and **TSUCHINOKO** ended up going out and completely securing the Anti-Air Cannons, removing any Rust presence. This allowed our ships to land and deliver supplies, and also allows us to further use the cannons in later missions.
