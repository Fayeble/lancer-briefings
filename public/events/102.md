# SHARD - ‚ÄèFungal Sea // 9.11.5014U

Finally, your boat for the **Fungal Sea** is finished. It's being transported to an abandoned dock you claimed some time ago, getting ready for your trip to make it to **the Old Data Continent**. Bring anything you need to the ship, and get settled for the ride.

While you're on the seas, there's a good chance you're going to encounter some other **Rust** ships. In that case, you should be at least a bit prepared for boardings or ship combat, however it shouldn't be anything too involved.

You won't have every person active at once, as that would clutter the ship too much - below the ship you have hangars for all your mechs. You'll pull them up if needed.
