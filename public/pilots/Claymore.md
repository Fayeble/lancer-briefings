*"There's nothing much to it really. When there's nothing to live for you tend to either give up or die trying to find something worth living for."* ***-Lill Lefebvre***

The [DATA EXPUNGED] family were seen as one of the last great pure houses.

Revered for their kindness and wisdom, many followed the family into exile one day.

No one knows for sure why they were exiled, every time you ask you get something different.

But one thing's for sure, a branch family was the one sentenced to exile, not the main family.

Despite having to start over far from the rest of civilization, everyone's lives slowly started to look like as the exile never happened.

The branch family however, was never the same.

Despite being known as the most compassionate branch, they never received any in return.

Many scorned them, even after all their deeds towards the people.

They blamed them. It's their fault they're out here, away from everything else.

Of course, there were some that were thankful.

Lill was one of these people.

During the exile, she was taken in by a family who needed extra hands.

They weren't the most loving and caring family, but they gave her enough.

Brought into a family of blacksmiths, she learned the trade like many before her.

But they were also teaching themselves something new.

They wanted to expand their horizons, what good is being a blacksmith if you could only make chunks of metal.

They learned machinery and electronics. Technology has greatly advanced. They are starting anew, as engineers.

Lill had a surprising knack for this sort of stuff. Machines would move exactly how she'd want them to, and she'd be the first to make her own helper arm.

Her family was proud of her. She was happy.
But soon after, it changed when they tackled something too ambitious.

She was the only survivor of a deadly accident.

Her body was weakened and there was nothing to go back to.

Even if she could, she was too young, what could she do alone?

The branch family however, offered her a job, and a place to stay.

Their only child was recently born, and would like to have someone to watch over her.

Preferably closer to her age than an adult, female, and strong. Lill was perfect for the job.

She accepted.

Given new life once again, Lill happily went through rigorous training to be a knight, and grew up alongside their child, Pop.

They got along well.

They were not partners in crime, but Lill would often look the other way for Pop's whimsical adventures, only butting in if things got unsafe.

She was happy.

But as if life it self loathed her, they nearly took everything away.

A few houses, jealous at finding out that the exiled house was still surviving, nay, thriving, wanted nothing more to crush them.

They attacked with an army of mechs.

The house of course had mechs of their own, but gave none of them to help.

The branch family was alone. And was the first, and only casualties.

Lill was ordered to keep Pop safe, and to run. She couldn't do anything. Those were mechs. She ran and ran. She ran until she couldn't anymore.

She found herself at the ruins of her old home.

Remembering everything she's lost, she felt weak. Never strong enough to save anyone.

Then she remembered something.

It was the ambitious project that killed her first family. A mech. A giant mech. Somehow still hidden in the rubble.

She hasn't touched machines in a long time. But, she couldn't do nothing while their family was in trouble.

She then turned on the mech, and it whirred to life. Somehow still working after years of neglect. It hummed in Lill's presence.

Pop entered through the hatch behind her, into a second seat.

Lill wanted to say something, but realized that it is the safest in the mech with her.

They started back to their home.

There was nothing to come back to.

Once the army got too close to the main family, they finally retaliated.

They just watched as the branch family, no, her family was wiped out.

"Good riddance." she heard some say.

She could barely contain her anger.

Pop then exited the mech, desperate to find any survivors.

Lill knew there were none left, the main family made sure of it.

Wait. Wait no don't

Planet is barren, full of ruins.

Deemed **Unsafe** for habitability despite lush vegetation.

*Something happened here. Something bad.

Whoever did it though, most likely wont do it again.

Because they either died and whoever killed them disappeared.*

***Or they have no reason to do it again.***
