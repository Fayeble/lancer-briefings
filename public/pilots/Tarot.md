Born in a small French space colony, Mortimer was raised with little exposure to what the galaxy had to offer. Half of her time was spent focused on her relatively safe yet uneventful life, enjoying and learning the simple things, while the other half was spent on the omninet, a much different environment though with limited options on what she could access. Together, this created a pleasant atmosphere for her, able to enjoy a simple life.

During this time, while she was growing up, she was introduced to magic, quickly growing attached with it with all the fun magic tricks she was shown. She thought about it more and more often until one day, she took it upon herself to start learning---in a few days' work, she used information from the omninet to present a magic trick her parents hadn't seen, and the applause she got set her on the path of magic from then on.

As she grew into adulthood and desired self-sufficiency, self-improvement, and adventure, she worked on a mech, using information on the omninet to suit it for her needs, and set off to make a job for herself. This job eventually turned out to be her as a freelance freighter, in which she spent a majority of her time cruising from planet to planet, using the omninet and/or practicing her magic all the while. Whenever she would drop on a planet, she would spend some time showing off her magic, pleasing crowds of people whose interest she caught, before setting off again.

Due to her lifestyle, Mortimer has relatively good experience in certain areas such as culture and socializing, but little in survival, combat, and the like. She is effectively a normal civilian, as far as one can tell.
