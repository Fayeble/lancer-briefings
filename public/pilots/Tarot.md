Mortimer Lindseth is a renowned name among a few different solar systems...or rather, a few companies and some people know her work. This girl offered a delivery service between planets, transporting packages across space with her mech. Whenever she finished a task, she would stick around the planet to work her second job: entertaining people with magic tricks! Magic is her true passion; her delivery service is just an excuse to show her passion to many people. (And also a better way of making money...)

Unfortunately, her jobs were halted when her mech was involved in a crash. The people she crashed with reworked her mech to be more suited for combat, and since then she's been working her third job.

*Magic piqued Her interest from the beginning. Crystal balls foretelling, cards introspecting, wands and hats to bring forth anything from nothing. To Her younger mind, and though still to Her young mind now, it was entertaining, it was thrilling, it was connecting! There were bonds to be made over such fantastical feats, although truly it was for Herself, to impress Herself with Her own developing skill. She sparkled inside with delight when others marveled at Her talent.*

*Of course, She learned magic and its magic was lost where it exchanged a new magic not of magic but of a magical sensation, as magic as She, a magician, understood it was not magic but reality. So bestowed upon Her in a mere deck of cards was a transcending magic of magic, still reality but of a magical reality, nix a real reality of flesh. And where a magician experiences magic again as they did if not more is a magical sensation beyond the first, at the least in Her eyes, now a magical domination.*

*Touching the cards, She can see anything, incontestably, theoretically, touching then no longer reality and instead another, with Her spirit, touching as well reality and not another, with Her whole being, wholly influential, to form a link of the real, that which would be false to one another, that which excising falsehood creates reality, of what was real yet partial, yet now impartial, wholly influenced.*

*Theoretical, as She has omnipotent potential, yet not omnipotent practice. She felt and saw both truths but drew breath in one, where She always has. Inspired, She began to express truths left untold in Her and others' own truths, in few and weak sounds. But Her magical domination, Her understanding, or belief in Her eyes, to be wholly influential, brought Her to practice, as She would regardless, now newly in both truths, even despite Her apprehension---*

*unknowing, thus uneasy, yet grateful, for the gift bestowed upon Her,*

*that which She may never know,*

*which may never ease Her,*

*which may merit nil or all of Her gratitude.*
