Mortimer Lindseth is a renowned name among a few different solar systems...or rather, a few companies and some people know her work. This girl offered a delivery service between planets, transporting packages across space with her mech. Whenever she finished a task, she would stick around the planet to work her second job: entertaining people with magic tricks! Magic is her true passion; her delivery service is just an excuse to show her passion to many people. (And also a better way of making money...)

Unfortunately, her jobs were halted when her mech was involved in a crash. The people she crashed with reworked her mech to be more suited for combat, and since then she's been working her third job.
