Evelyn wasn't sought out, per say, she sought out [INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE]. One day she was just... inside the base with her mech parked in the garage, eating my damn snacks. She claims she heard whispers of us on the omninet and that she decided that this would be a fun exercise for her to gain more street cred in the hacking scene? She's a weird one, don't let her start talking about anything omninet related or she will make you wish you were fighting a manticore pilot who's got nothing to lose, __trust me__.
