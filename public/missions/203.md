# Mission // #203
## Anti-Air-Assault

Anti-Air batteries reside in the desert that are stopping from our support from reaching our location. Take control of them, or take them out.

# Goals
- Find and confront the anti-air battery base.
- You have two ways of tackling the situation.
  - Destroy each anti-air battery, that way they won't fire upon anything again.
  - Try to gain control of the batteries through hacking - you won't need a hacker on-site.
# Stakes
- Failing to destroy the batteries will seriously delay further support.
# Bonuses
- Controlling the batteries will give us a means of combatting any air forces that the Rusts or any future enemies may throw upon our base or the planet.

# Reserves
- 2 APCs, which may be manned by Pyre or off-screen characters.
- 6 Turrets, although setup for them will be severely limited.
