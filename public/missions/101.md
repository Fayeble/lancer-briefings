# Mission // #001
## Dreams of Reclamation
# Goals
- Introduce yourselves to the Reclamation City.
- Establish some contacts, find some jobs, get some equipment.
- Careful of who you talk to.

# Stakes
- Establishing good connections is key to our success on this planet. We don't have much to work with, so no contacts means no chance at surviving the planet.

# Reserves
- None.
