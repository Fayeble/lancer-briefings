# Mission // #101
## Boat-Business

With very little transport at your disposal, it's probably time you get something to help you get across the seas - especially since you intend to transport your mechs and any loot you find in the upcoming mission.

# Goals
- Find a way to acquire a boat.
  - Timewalker suggests you see what your factory can make for you.

# Stakes
- Failing to acquire a boat will seriously delay the mission at hand and risk losing the resources.

# Reserves
- Two APCs to deploy if necessary.
- 6 Mini Turrets
- 3 Invisibility/Disguise Cloaks
- An Anti-Air Battery (one use per mission).
