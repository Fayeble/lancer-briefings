# Excursion // #002
## Accelerating-Action

Expanding your range of influence is important, especially when traveling far distances might use up a lot of your fuel and resources. Setting up a base in the **Alpine** would be great if possible, considering the large **Rust** foothold there and the far distance needed to travel every time. **TIMECALLER** knows a good place.

# Goals
- Establish a base within the **Alpine Orbit Station**.

# Stakes
- Failing to establish a base will limit our presence in the **Alpine**, and make it harder to pressure the **Rust**.

# Reserves
- Two APCs to deploy.
- 6 Mini Turrets
- 3 Invisibility/Disguise Cloaks
- An Anti-Air Battery (one use per mission).
