# Mission // #202
## Radio-Static

Taking on a Rust outpost is no easy task. You're going to need a mix of knowledge, strategy, and brawn to get through it.

# Goals
- Recon the Radio Tower and gain an understanding of what you might need to do or how you will engage.
- Engage the tower if you deem possible. You do not have to clear it out, as that might be more than you can handle. Focus on trying to sabotage or capture.

# Stakes
- If we don't hinder the operations of the tower, Rust attacks will be come more prominent and harder.

# Reserves
- Sawtooth Shredder (1, from Fordola)
- Kraken Crasher (1, from Fordola)
- 2 APCs you can deploy, although they have to be RPVs if so.
- 6 Deployable Turrets.
