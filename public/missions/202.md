# Mission // #202
## Radio-Static

Taking out a Rust outpost is no easy task. You're going to need a mix of knowledge, strategy, and brawn to get through it.

# Goals
- Recon the Radio Tower and gain an understanding of what you might need to do or how you will engage.
- Engage and clear out the tower if you feel able to.

# Stakes
- Provoking them will surely cause trouble no matter what, but leaving the tower operational will likely cause attacks to descend upon our base more and with more ferocity.

# Reserves
- Sawtooth Shredder (1, from Fordola)
- Kraken Crasher (1, from Fordola)
- 2 APCs you can deploy, although they have to be RPVs if so.
