# Mission // #103
## Old-Data-New-Life

With the Rusts repelled, you peacefully drift the rest of the way to your destination. While it may not be obvious at first, the scanners show some insanely massive structure under the water, and very deep down too. Better be quick down there, and be careful of any security.

# Goals
- Explore the Old Data Continent.

# Stakes
- Be cautious, as there may be security to trip.
- Taking too long may cause the Rusts to catch up and counter-raid.

# Reserves
- 1 Gungnir, Lævateinn, Mjölnir Reinforcements
- 6 PC Reinforcements
- Your Personal Reserves
