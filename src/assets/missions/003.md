## RA-Wrestle

Getting some rarer materials has proven to be a bit hard, but you have a seller. Although... they have an odd request before you can acquire them.

Up for some competition? 

# Goals
- Participate in a recreational Mech Arena, and win.
  - Be extra stylish and perhaps you get extra rewards.

# Stakes
- Failing to win the competition will cause our seller to pull out, making us wait longer for the resources.

# Reserves
- You cannot bring Reserves on this mission.
