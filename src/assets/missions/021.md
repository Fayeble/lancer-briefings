# Mission // #021
## Alpine-Hotline

Out on recon, you are looking for either something useful or some sight of the Rusts, and possibly a method of attack at them.

# Goals
- Explore and discover what you can of the Alpine Orbital Station.
- If you get spotted, do your best to keep them from running away and alerting the rest.

# Stakes
- Letting them control the area will deny us some potentially key resources and intel.

# Reserves
- Sawtooth Shredder (1, from Fordola)
- Kraken Crasher (1, from Fordola)
- 2 APCs you can deploy, although they have to be RPVs if so.
