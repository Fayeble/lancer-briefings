# Mission // #002

## Vigilant Gaze

Expanding your range of influence is important, especially when traveling far distances might use up a lot of your fuel and resources. Setting up a base in the **Alpine** would be great if possible, considering the large **Rust** foothold there and the far distance needed to travel every time. **TIMECALLER** knows a good place.

# Goals

- Defend Evergreen and protect Evergreen’s reactor.

# Stakes

- If the mission is failed, Evergreen’s reactors will be destroyed, forcing the colony to use backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function.

# Reserves

- None at this time.
