Half of her time was spent focused on her relatively safe yet uneventful life, enjoying and learning the simple things, while the other half was spent on the omninet, a much different environment though with limited options on what she could access. Together, this created a pleasant atmosphere for her, able to enjoy a simple life. </p><p>During this time, while she was growing up, she was introduced to magic, quickly growing attached with it with all the fun magic tricks she was shown. She thought about it more and more often until one day, she took it upon herself to start learning---in a few days' work, she used information from the omninet to present a magic trick her parents hadn't seen, and the applause she got set her on the path of magic from then on. </p><p>As she grew into adulthood and desired self-sufficiency, self-improvement, and adventure, she worked on a mech, using information on the omninet to suit it for her needs, and set off to make a job for herself. This job eventually turned out to be her as a freelance freighter, in which she spent a majority of her time cruising from planet to planet, using the omninet and/or practicing her magic all the while. Whenever she would drop on a planet, she would spend some time showing off her magic, pleasing crowds of people whose interest she caught, before setting off again. </p><p>Due to her lifestyle, Mortimer has relatively good experience in certain areas such as culture and socializing, but little in survival, combat, and the like. She is effectively a normal civilian, as far as one can tell.</p><hr><p>. . .</p><p><em>Magic piqued Her interest from the beginning. Crystal balls foretelling, cards introspecting, wands and hats to bring forth anything from nothing. To Her younger mind, and though still to Her young mind now, it was entertaining, it was thrilling, it was connecting! There were bonds to be made over such fantastical feats, although truly it was for Herself, to impress Herself with Her own developing skill. She sparkled inside with delight when others marveled at Her talent.</em></p><p><em>Of course, She learned magic and its magic was lost where it exchanged a new magic not of magic but of a magical sensation, as magic as She, a magician, understood it was not magic but reality. So bestowed upon Her in a mere deck of cards was a transcending magic of magic, still reality but of a magical reality, nix a real reality of flesh. And where a magician experiences magic again as they did if not more is a magical sensation beyond the first, at the least in Her eyes, now a magical domination.</em></p><p><em>Touching the cards, She can see anything, incontestably, theoretically, touching then no longer reality and instead another, with Her spirit, touching as well reality and not another, with Her whole being, wholly influential, to form a link of the real, that which would be false to one another, that which excising falsehood creates reality, of what was real yet partial, yet now impartial, wholly influenced.</em></p><p><em>Theoretical, as She has omnipotent potential, yet not omnipotent practice. She felt and saw both truths but drew breath in one, where She always has. Inspired, She began to express truths left untold in Her and others' own truths, in few and weak sounds. But Her magical domination, Her understanding, or belief in Her eyes, to be wholly influential, brought Her to practice, as She would regardless, now newly in both truths, even despite Her apprehension---</em></p><p><em>unknowing, thus uneasy, yet grateful, for the gift bestowed upon Her,</em></p><p><em>that which She may never know,</em></p><p><em>which may never ease Her,</em></p><p><em>which may merit nil or all of Her gratitude.</em></p><p>. . .</p><hr>","quirks":[],"current_hp":7,"background":"Ex-Freighter Magician","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"8f4a06cc-c49e-47c5-894d-e8ec62b56d52","name":"Førecast","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":13,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Thu Dec 22 2022 22:28:16 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"alt_hercules.png","cloud_portrait":"https://i.imgur.com/pxKfoRf.png","loadouts":[{"id":"80bf1c30-7b0c-495d-a7fc-da7c83ba695b","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_type_i_flight_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"TYPE-I FLIGHT SYSTEM","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"PERSONALIZATIONS","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_h0r_os_system_upgrade_i","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"This system upgrade appears to add auxiliary INSTINCT systems that are capable of autonomous operation independent of the base INSTINCT rig, increasing the efficacy of systemic invasion attempts.
