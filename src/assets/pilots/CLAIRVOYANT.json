Every descendant of Olympus - every member of the illustrious Aristarchus familia - will attain a lofty title. If you don't? Then it is a simple matter to revoke your origin.<br><br>Inkra Aristarchus. The pride of the Aristarchus family, along with perhaps one or two of her siblings. Blood, however, is a violent tether in this family. Families must be strong... and what better way to cultivate strength than to prune the weak? Pit your cultured offspring against one another? The successes will rise, and the failures will fall. That's how it has always been. Natural selection. Inkra couldn't forget this lesson - this insinuation from her mother - if she tried. Being presented as a prodigy puts a bounty on your head. Snuff the young prodigy's spark, halt the inferno that it'll become. Sometimes she still feels the fingers around her neck.<br><br>That's a cruel ultimatum. One could attribute Inkra's dedication to this unforgiving bloodline as tenacity or determination, but the truth is much more mundane. If you're good at something, why stop? Inkra aced tests meant for older kids and passed exams some adults couldn't even fathom. The steps of her early life were paved before her, and it's so easy to walk forward when people are pushing you. Surgeries. Medicines. Therapies. Tortures, if you asked her back then, but so many told her these were gifts and boons, shaping her into the ideal successor. Features lodged in her skull, pressed into her brain, her eyes, her heart. Perfect the perfect body, sharpen the honed mind. Turn problems into solutions with the minimal effort. Turn those who oppose you into nothingnesss all the same.<br><br>Naturally, she was in for a rude awakening; the Olympus Academy teaches someone how to excel, sure, but what of personality? Morality? When facing down a barrel held in the hands of someone who should love you, what then? There's no button to press, no command to execute, no machine to activate to solve these sorts of problems. The solution is apparent but the intangible repercussions forewarn her - hesitation is unfamiliar and untrained, worry pains her chest and clouds her mind. The systems she feels at home with are simple and logical, like her parents, like the academy, like her quarters - like how things should be.<br><br>And her Practical Olympus Exclusive Mandated Field Experience has only just begun.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":6,"background":"Super Soldier","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"6515ba21-bbb4-4b70-a7c4-b55b8143f99e","name":"ENCASED IN ASH","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_goblin","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":5,"boost":0,"current_hp":10,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":3,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Sun Oct 22 2023 07:28:04 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"87a68d5c-9a69-427b-8068-ae0f3ce74840","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_h0r_os_system_upgrade_i","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"This system upgrade appears to add auxiliary INSTINCT systems that are capable of autonomous operation independent of the base INSTINCT rig, increasing the efficacy of systemic invasion attempts.
